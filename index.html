            <h1>Dream Big</h1>
            <h2>Become a Web Developer</h2>
            <p class="half">
                I already learned the basic HTML and CSS.I can build any simple website.Even i can teach my friends how
                to make a simple website.My goal is to become a senior web developer and learn advanced topics.Senior
                web developer are very advanced.I want to become a advanced developer.Because our next genaration are
                depented on advanced technology.Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have
                within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.As a
                young child, my dream occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I grew older and my interests changed, my
                dream profession changed also. Although most of these dreams were not very long lived, one occupational
                dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I passionately pursue.



                It all started when my grandparents purchased their first computer. Being as this was the first computer
                I had ever used, I did not know how to use it very well. I mostly used it for games, which my grandma
                would set up for me to play. I also drew pictures with the computer's paint program, the functionality
                of which, unfortunately, was very limited. The relatively new computer industry's technology could not
                produce enough colors to portray very realistic pictures. Despite this fact, I spent many contented
                hours creating images on my grandparent's computer.
